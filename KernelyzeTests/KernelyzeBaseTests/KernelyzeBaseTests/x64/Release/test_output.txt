 Test of Brent-related functionality
 Check a nice problem: 
 The zero of sin(x) between -0.25 and 0.25, should be 0: 
 0.00000000000000
 Check a problem without a zero: 
 sin(x) has no zero between 0.001 and 0.002, this should be NaN: 
 NaN
 Find a minimum over a nice interval: 
 The minimum of sin(x) between -pi and zero is:  -1.00000000000000
 This minimum is achieved at:  -1.57079632675310
 Find a minimum over a large interval: 
 The minimum of sin(x) between 0 and 100 is:  -1.00000000000000
