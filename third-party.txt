KernelyzeBase uses third-party codes available under terms distinct from the license here:

1) Michel Olagnon (from his ORDERPACK, available at http://www.fortran-2000.com/, 
    "A WEB site on the way to more public domain utilities");

2) "Numerical Computing with Modern Fortran" by Richard J. Hanson and Tim Hopkins,
    SIAM OT134 (2013).  "SIAM grants a royalty-free license to copy
    and distribute the software code posted on the book's
    supplemental Web page, provided the source is acknowledged."
    (Statement above Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication
    Data.)  The authors also state that (page x of the Introduction):
    "there is no restriction on the use of the software for any
    purpose.  The only requirement is that, if use is made of
    our codes, our book and SIAM are referenced in any derived
    work."  Kernelyze gratefully references the book (cited above)
    and SIAM, and thanks the authors for their excellent work;
	
3) fmm.f90 from Public Domain Aeronautical Software (this is
    in the public domain, as the website's title indicates; the
	site is http://www.pdas.com/index.html and is very helpful)

The book and the two websites referenced above are all very
helpful; the interested reader would be well-served by reading
the book and visiting the websites.

Modifications made in KernelyzeBase to these codes do fall under
the license used for this project.
